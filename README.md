# ðŸ’« About

Revars (React variables) is a React **state management system** which is

- mutable
- simple 
- no boilerplate code needed

# ðŸ“š Core concept

Basically, every revar is just a javascript object with mutable fields. This object can have nested objects at any level and arrays. Core concept is dead easy - you use [*buildRevar*](#create-revar) to obtain array of two elements. First element is the revar object itself (which is absolutely mutable), second element is a hook you can use in functional components to make them rerender when accorded revar is somehow changed. Simple and powerful! ðŸš€

# ðŸ“” API

There is one method you can import from this package.

## <a id='create-use-revar'></a>**buildRevar**

```ts
function buildRevar<T extends object>(initialState: T): [T, () => void]
```

Returns a tuple of revar itself and a hook which can be used for functional components rerendering.

# âœ¨ [Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/revars-complex-todos-demo-77qo3)

Here is some basic example. Please feel free to take a look at more complex example at code sandbox (click on "Example").

```ts
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { buildRevar } from "revars";

const [counter, useCounterRerender] = buildRevar({ currentValue: 0 });

function useCounterIncrement() {
    useEffect(() => {
        let interval = setInterval(() => {
            counter.currentValue++;
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(interval); 
    })
}

const resetCounter = () => { counter.currentValue = 0; }


function Counter() {
    // hook we use to make component rerender on every revar change
    useCounterRerender();
    useCounterIncrement();

    return <div>
        <span>Counter value - {counter.currentValue}</span>
        <button onClick={() => resetCounter()}>Reset counter</button>
    </div>
}
```

# ðŸ’¥ Warning

Package is still under development and pretty unstable. Do not use it in production code for now.

Thank you for choosing revars! â˜•
