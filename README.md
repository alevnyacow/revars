# ðŸ’« About

Revars (React variables) is a React **state management system** which is

- mutable
- simple 
- no boilerplate code needed

# ðŸ“š Core concept

Basically, every revar is just a javascript object with mutable fields. This object can have nested objects at any level and arrays. Core concept is dead easy - function you obtain via [*createUseRevar*](#create-use-revar) can be used **anywhere**. If it's used inside of a functional component **as a hook** you obtain revar value and this component will be rerendered every time this revar is changed. If it's used anywhere **outside of a functional component** you just obtain revar value and you are still able to modify it. Simple and powerful! ðŸš€

# ðŸ“” API

There is one method you can import from this package.

## <a id='create-use-revar'></a>**createUseRevar**

```ts
function createUseRevar<T extends object>(initialState: T): () => T
```

Returns a function which obtains revar value and provides functional components to be rerendered on revar changes.

# ðŸ’¥ Warning

Package is still under development and pretty unstable. Do not use it in production code for now.

Thank you for choosing revars! â˜•
